This code still needs work to do.
This is a website where a user is taking a quiz
 and when  the user click the start button
the timer starts  at 60 secons and 
the questions will start presenting with some possible answers
whether the user answer a question correclty o wrong, this will be presented with another question
if the user answers a question incorrectly
5s is subtracted from the clock I can save my the user name and the score.
I still need to work on the local storage. I had tried with no success. Any recommendatios is accepted. Thank you!
